      <h1>ExerciseTracker</h1>
      <p>This is an application where I record exercise data focusing on building the app using the <strong>Repository Pattern</strong> and <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>. I will be using EF Core for the database backend, and will focus on only one type of exercise to keep the app simple.<br>
      And to illustrate the Separation of Concerns by the repository pattern, I created a class to replace Entity Framework by Dapper or in my repository. I noticed I didn't need to touch my controller class at all!</p>
